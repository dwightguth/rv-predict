rv-predict-c (2.1.1-1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Build the Predict runtime for QNX on 64-bit ARM. Also, make `qrvpc
    -Vgcc_ntoaarch64le` cross-build for the same.

  * Fix a bug that would crash some programs that used thread-specific
    key destructors.

  * Suppress `-- Window ... --` diagnostic output by default.  Add an
    `rvpa` option and an environment variable to re-enable the output.

  * Omit mentions of rvpx(1), which has been removed.

  * Ensure errno is 0 when the application program begins.

  * Add a new option flag, `-b`, that makes `rvpdump` print the bytes
  * comprising each event in hexadecimal.

  * Implement instrumentation for C++ virtual-table pointer
    loads/stores.

  * Add more example code.

  * Repair a bug in Predict's instrumentation pass where it added bad
    LLVM IR that referred to a value before the statement that loaded it
    had been performed, causing the LLVM backend subsequently to crash.

rv-predict-c (2.1.0-1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Fix a bug where programs that `fork(2)` would hang.

  * Port to QNX.  Provide `qrvpc` for cross-building for QNX for x86_64.

  * Add an `ld(1)` replacement, `rvpld`.

  * Several improvements to the function and appearance of the HTML
    report.

  * Fix poor wording in reports that mention locks. 

  * Add synopses for the four categories of data race Predict detects.

  * Fix a bug that crashed some programs that used the POSIX
    thread-local storage (TLS) APIs (`pthread_getspecific(3)`,
    `pthread_setspecific(3)`).

  * Fix a but that crashed programs linked to dynamic libraries whose
    initializers used POSIX mutexes.

  * Separately instrument both the native Linux `signal(3)`, which is
    implemented using `sigaction(2)`, and the System V variant that is
    provided by `signal(2)`.

  * Support the `sigaction(2)` flag `SA_RESETHAND`.

  * Fix a bug that crashed some programs that used `memset(3)`.

  * Reduce report clutter: do not prepend `.../` to abbreviated paths.

  * Let the operator direct reports to a file or to a file descriptor
    using environment variables `RVP_REPORT_FILE` and `RVP_REPORT_FD`,
    respectively.

  * Fix a defect in the report symbolization that broke some of
    the examples.

rv-predict-c (2.0-1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Improve compatibility with LLVM coverage tools.

  * In data-race reports, print the source filename and line number,
    but don't print the column number, because LLVM appears to generate
    incorrect column numbers when coverage is enabled.  Do not print
    line number 0.

  * Avoid recording program traces where a program appears to enter a
    signal handler when the signal mask does not allow, or to read a
    signal mask that is inconsistent with the masks that were written.

  * Make `rvpsymbolize` correctly symbolize inputs that contain more
    than one function address.

  * Add to `rvpa(1)` an option `--max-interrupt-depth depth` that limits
    the level of recursion Predict will explore.

  * Print correct stack traces for interrupted threads and signals.  Fix
    a bug where a function entered in a previous window may not have
    appeared in a data race report for the current window.

  * Change the appearance of the HTML report and add controls to the
    data-race detail display for moving to the previous/next detailed
    display.

  * Introduce an interrupt personality, `tiaic`, for the Texas
    Instruments ARM Interrupt Controller.

  * Add an option, --interrupts-target=N (and variants), that tells how
    many times to try to run each interrupt in each window by copying
    interrupt traces from prior windows, if necessary.  Describe the
    option in the manual page.

  * Add {} to more instruction pointers in the symbol-friendly output of
    `rvpdump` so that `rvpsymbolize` will turn the pointers to function
    names.

  * Fix bugs that sometimes caused Predict-instrumented programs to hang
    when they received a signal such as SIGINT (Control-C).

  * Improve the examples for the Renesas 78k0 simulation.  Improve
    interrupt examples and their documentation.

  * Improve performance of Predict's data-race analysis.

  * Provide an example from Volker Stolz.

  * Add modular simulations for spontaneous signal entry.  Document the
    signal simulations.

  * Streamline the production of HTML reports.

  * Add options for adjusting the timeouts used by the data-race
    analysis.

  * Install `rv-html-report` as `rvp-html-report` to avoid conflicts
    with RV-Match.

  * Add instrumentation to the `signal(2)` system call.

  * Fix some bugs in the `sigaction(2)` instrumentation.

  * When the instrumented application is cancelled with, say, Control-C,
    don't cancel the analysis, too.

  * Cancel analysis if, after the application program has finished
    running, we receive another signal like SIGINT (Control-C), SIGHUP,
    SIGQUIT, et cetera.

  * Check the status of the analysis process and squeak on `stderr` if
    it exited on a signal.

  * Correctly forward `rvpc` command-line arguments that contain
    whitespace to `clang`.

  * Fix some bugs affecting atomic 8- and 16-bit stores and atomic
    16-bit read-modify-write.

  * Fix some data-race analysis crashes.

  * Add a `--version` command-line flag to `rvpc` and `rvpc++` commands.

  * Add a command-line option, `--parallel-smt #`, that tells how many
    threads to run the SMT solver in.

  * Improve the `rvpdump(1)` manual page.

  * Prevent a diagnostic assertion from occurring when the Predict
    runtime expected (incorrectly) for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to be
    masked---they cannot be masked.

  * Perform online analysis by default.  That is, run the instrumented
    program and the data-race analysis concurrently.
