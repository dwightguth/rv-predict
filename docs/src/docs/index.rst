========

RV-Predict is the only dynamic data race detector that is both sound and
maximal. *Dynamic* means that it executes the program in order to extract
an execution trace to analyze. *Sound* means that it only reports races
which are real (i.e., no false positives). And *maximal* means that it finds
all the races that can be found by any other sound race detector analyzing
the same execution trace. The technology underlying RV-Predict is best
explained in the following papers:
