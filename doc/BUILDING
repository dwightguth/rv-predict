Configuring a build environment:

    On Ubuntu, install prerequisite packages:
 
        sudo apt install m4
        sudo apt install make # GNU make
        sudo apt install maven mk-configure
        sudo apt install opam openjdk-8-jdk-headless
        sudo apt install pandoc
        sudo apt install sed

    Here are some other programs that must be available:

        awk
        clang+llvm-3.9.0 with development components (.h, .a/.so files)
        grep
        lex
        libarchive
        yacc

    Configure an object directory if you're going to use one.

    At the top level of the RV-Predict sources, configure OCaml by running

        ./opam-setup.sh

Make sure that you have Clang 3.9 in your PATH.

Other notes:

   OPAM packages required by the unified error reporting in errors/:

        Probably NOT needed: zarith mlgmp 

	Definitely needed: atdgen atdj csv ocamlbuild-atdgen ocp-ocamlres uri

	Maybe needed: camomile ctypes ctypes-foreign uuidm

        Install with `opam install -y <packages here>`.
