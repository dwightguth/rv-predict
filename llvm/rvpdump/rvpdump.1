.Sh NAME
.Nm rvpdump
.Nd renders an
.Tn RV-Predict/C

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar binary
.Op Fl t Ar plain
.Op Fl t Ar symbol-friendly
.Op Ar trace-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a trace file from
.Ar trace-file
or, if no
.Ar trace-file
is given, from stdin.
It writes the trace in human-readable format to stdout, one event
per line.
.Pp
.Nm
can be used in conjunction with
.Xr rvpsymbolize 1
to render a trace file with line number information and symbols for
data & instruction addresses.
.Pp
Command-line options modify the behavior of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "... symbol-friendly"
.It Fl b
Print every event with the bytes comprising it in hexadecimal.
.It Fl g
Print every event with a generation number.
.It Fl n Ar number
Print only
.Ar number
events.
.It Fl t Ar binary
write
.Dq binary
output.
I.e., write the same format that instrumented programs write and that
.Nm
reads.
.It Fl t Ar plain
write
.Dq plain
output.
This is the default output format.
.It Fl t Ar symbol-friendly
Mark addresses in the output so that
.Xr rvpsymbolize 1
can symbolize them.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Page through a trace produced by
the example program in
.Pa /usr/share/examples/rv-predict-c/c11/ ,
.Nm lpcq ,
with addresses symbolized:
.Bd -literal
$ rvpdump -t symbol-friendly rvpredict.trace | rvpsymbolize ./lpcq | less
.Ed
.Pp
Copy the first 100 events from one trace file into a new trace file:
.Bd -literal
$ rvpdump -n 100 -t binary rvpredict.trace > short.trace
.Ed
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
