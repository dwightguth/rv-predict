SOURCE LAYOUT

	pass/: standalone instrumentation pass derived from
	    Thread Sanitizer (tsan)
	runtime/: standalone runtime derived from tsan

BUILDING

To build both the runtime and the instrumentation pass:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

The LLVM installation on office.runtimeverification.com:2222 is screwed up, so
I recommend fetching and extracting a CLang+LLVM pre-built binary from
http://llvm.org/releases/ and running cmake with the appropriate -DLLVM_DIR=
path.  I have extracted 3.8.1 in my home directory, so I run cmake like so:

	cmake -DLLVM_DIR=$HOME/clang+llvm-3.8.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/share/llvm/cmake ..
